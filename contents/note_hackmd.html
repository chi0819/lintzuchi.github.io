	<h2>Linux</h2>
	<pre>
	Why I use Linux as my computer system :

	Linux is an interesting system, in the world, there are lots of devices use Linux as system.
	Because it's <mark>portable and only occupy small size of disk</mark>.
	It's the best choice to your daily life. So I buy a second-hand MacBook Pro for using Linux.
	Huh ! If you only have one Computer, It's not a good idea follow my note to install Linux.
	Because I had formatted my MacBook Pro to install Linux, that is mean MacOS had been deleted
	and <i>never come back</i>.
	Before I successfully use Linux as my computer's system, I had formatted my computer's disk more 
	than 10 times, due to the configuration of my Linux setup, I crash the system many times, but every
	times I try to find out the problems and solve it, and other problems appear.
	Although the path to configure the system to the best is extremely difficult, but it's benefit a
	great deal.

		<pre>
	
	The reason why I choose Arch Linux as my first Linux system was inspired by my high school teacher 
	named Chao-Yuan Tu, he said <i>"when you can't turning back you will learn it well"</i>. So I bought a second-hand MacBook Pro,
	deleted MacOS and install Arch Linux. Nowadays there are many distributions for Linux, like Ubuntu, Fedora ......
	If you want to know more about Linux distributions, you can go to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions">wiki</a>.
	Because Arch Linux is a <mark>flexible</mark> system, so there are many things you need to do by yourself.
	Arch Linux only provides commad-line version, so if you want to use GUI operating system, you can follow my <a href="https://hackmd.io/PpbubeaHQ5KgQg_rA8QJwQ">note</a> to install a cool desktop and system.
	There are many problems appear when I use Arch Linux, so I write a note for recording the <a href="faq.html">solutions</a>.

	<h2>Neovim/Vim</h2>
	<pre>
	Why I use Neovim as my editor :

	Vim is an old editor, differ from modern editor like VScode, there are a lots of skills you should learn 
	before use Vim. <del>A story about Vim is a game about how to escape Vim</del>
	For Windows or MacOS user, it's akward to use h, j, k, l key to move your cursor on the screen. But if you 
	familiar with the operation of Vim, it's actually a powerful editor for developing.
	In my opinion, there is an upgrade version of Vim called Neovim. Compare Neovim with Vim, Neovim is more flexible
	than Vim, there are a lots of plugs on github support Neovim, so that you can decorate your workspace and add
	useful tools make coding more convenient and easily.
