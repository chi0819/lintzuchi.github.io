	Why I use Linux as my computer system :

	Linux is an interesting system, in the world, there are lots of devices use Linux as system.
	Because it's <mark>portable and only occupy small size of disk</mark>.
	It's the best choice to your daily life. So I buy a second-hand MacBook Pro for using Linux.
	Huh ! If you only have one Computer, It's not a good idea follow my note to install Linux.
	Because I had formatted my MacBook Pro to install Linux, that is mean MacOS had been deleted
	and <i>never come back</i>.
	Before I successfully use Linux as my computer's system, I had formatted my computer's disk more 
	than 10 times, due to the configuration of my Linux setup, I crash the system many times, but every
	times I try to find out the problems and solve it, and other problems appear.
	Although the path to configure the system to the best is extremely difficult, but it's benefit a
	great deal.

	<h2>Neovim/Vim</h2>
	<pre>
	Why I use Neovim as my editor :

	Vim is an old editor, differ from modern editor like VScode, there are a lots of skills you should learn 
	before use Vim. <del>A story about Vim is a game about how to escape Vim</del>
	For Windows or MacOS user, it's akward to use h, j, k, l key to move your cursor on the screen
